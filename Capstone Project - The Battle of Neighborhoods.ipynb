We will use web scraping from Wikipedia in order to get all the neighborhoods in London. we will use the following columns from the table: Location,London borough,Post town, Postcode district. Dial code and OS grid ref will be remove during data cleaning since this information has no added value for our goal. The Wikipedia page can be found in : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_areas_of_London\n2. Will add the Latitude and Longitude for each neighborhood using geocode.\n3. Visualize london map including the neighborhood dataframe we described using folium (same as we did for New York & Toronto)\n4. Since we want to open our restaurant during lunch time we need to aim for neighborhoods with many schools/workplaces. People are staying there during the day and look for quick lunch place. In order to do so we will use Foursquare API to get the number of workplaces and schools in every neighborhood and summarize it in order to compare between neighborhoods.\n5. Will recommend the best neighborhood based on the data above\n\n"
